          returns that are comparable to those of a broad market index.</span
        >
        By buying the individual securities that make up the index or investing
        in an index mutual fund or exchange traded fund (ETF) that closely
        tracks the underlying index, investors can use the<span

        >
        to mimic the performance of a particular index, typically an equity or
        fixed-income index. <br /><br />
        Index investing has a number of benefits. For starters, empirical
        research shows that over the long term, index investing outperforms
        active management. Many of the biases and uncertainties that can occur
        in a stock-picking technique are eliminated when an investor adopts a
        hands-off strategy.

          Gary Gensler was once the Under Secretary of the Treasury in charge of
          decisions regarding U.S. financial markets, debt management, and
          financial services, while Gregory Baer served as the previous
          Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Financial Institutions. The
          Great Mutual Fund Trap: An Investment Recovery Plan was written by the
          two of them.
          <span style="font-weight: 800"
            >The target audience for their book is Americans who invest in the
            stock or bond market to meet long-term objectives like funding </span
          >their children's college education or insuring their own retirement,
          but who, according to Baer and Gensler, are doing so at the expense of
          unwarranted costs and dangers. <br /><br />
          The authors, who want to warn consumers about the pitfalls in the
          financial markets, provide new options and opportunities for investors
          to
          <span style="font-weight: 800">increase returns and reduce risks</span
          >, such as switching from active to passive investing, buying
          international stocks, avoiding "hot funds," and investing in index
          funds. Baer and Gensler give practical guidance that will be helpful
          to regular investors in a conversational and simple-to-read style.

          technology bubbles of the 20th century, burst after the publication of
          this eighth edition. It was possible to give investors who lost money
          during the first bubble a pass since they lacked access to Malkiel's
          book. However, it's amazing how eagerly Internet traders<span

            ignored</span
          >

          <span style="font-weight: 800"
            >every investor should examine this book,</span
          >
          or at the very least, touch it on the forehead. <br /><br />
          The majority of investment books are unreliable because their authors
          are salespeople who are truly attempting to sell you something rather
          than provide you with information. Malkiel lacks enthusiasm. He is a
          professor with the academic rigor of an actual financial economist,
          yet he writes with the vividness of an excellent journalist.

          The investing game:
          <span style="font-weight: 800">Can anyone win?</span> The task may
          appear practically impossible given the small number of mutual funds
          that deliver returns that outperform the market. However, there is
          still a small elite group of financial experts that consistently
          outperform the market. What differentiates them? Their competitive
          advantage is alpha,
          <span style="font-weight: 800"
            >which is the percentage of an investment fund's return </span
          >that is produced exclusively by the portfolio manager's expertise.
          Since there have been financial markets, investors, traders, and
          speculators have all looked for a reliable source of alpha.
