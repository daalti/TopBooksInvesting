        The <span style="font-weight: 800">simplest and most reliable </span>way
        to build a big portfolio return is to use a
        <span style="font-weight: 800">buy-and-hold </span>strategy. The
        majority of investors are best served by purchasing and keeping stocks
        for the long term, but this strategy still offers a lot of latitude in
        terms of choosing which specific businesses and investment themes to
        emphasize.

          13 of today's most popular investment strategies: the real story.
          <br /><br />
          - 10 important lessons for all investors
          <br /><br />
          - Busting the persistent market myths
          <br /><br />
          - Bonds versus high dividend stocks: which is better and safer?
          <br /><br />
          - Are cheap stocks really that way?
          <br /><br />
          - Should you make a quality purchase? Momentum? The newest trend? What
          else?
          <br /><br />
          You have heard them. (Possibly from your broker, too!) They're the
          "can't lose" financial tales that assure you of a risk-free route to
          success.
          <br /><br />
          - Buy businesses that are trading below book value.
          <br /><br />
          - "Follow the flow."
          <br /><br />
          - "Invest in low P/E equities."
          <br /><br />
          - "Remain true to quality."
          <br /><br />
          - After awful news, "Buy."
          <br /><br />
          - "Buy when there's good news."
          <br /><br />
          - "Suit up for the insiders."
          <br /><br />
          - "Follow Warren Buffett's lead," someone said.
          <br /><br />
          - And it goes on and on.
          <br /><br />
          - They make good sound. But do they actually function? You're going to
          learn soon.
          <br /><br />
          <span style="font-weight: 800">In Investment Fables</span>, one of the
          top investment researchers in the world analyzes the data for 13 of
          the most popular methods now being used, providing unbiased responses
          to the queries that your broker is unable to address. Has it been
          successful in the long run? In the near future? Does it still make
          sense if it formerly made sense? Are the hoped-for benefits only a
          statistical illusion? Could it function as a piece of your overall
          investing plan? What drawbacks exist, and how can you lessen them?
          <br /><br />
          This book is absolutely essential if you wish to make wiser investment
          selections.

          Renowned investment advisor
          <span style="font-weight: 800">Marc Faber </span>sets out to find
          tomorrow s gold the outperforming asset classes of the future. Far
          from being a sensational reading of the runes, this book delves deep
          into the past, to chart how old investor trends developed and assess
          how new patterns might emerge. Change is the thread. As Faber points
          out, the world is experiencing a transformation as great as Europe s
          late-15th Century golden age of discovery and the Industrial
          Revolution of the19th Century events that altered the commercial face
          of the Earth forever. <br /><br />
          <span style="font-weight: 800"
            >Faber also locates investment opportunities</span
          >
          from this <span style="font-weight: 800">dramatic backdrop</span> in a
          world where social, political, and economic situations are changing at
          an alarming rate. <br /><br />
          <span style="font-weight: 800"
            >Asia's population of three billion people will have a significant
            impact on the world, warns Faber,</span
          >
          adding that it is improbable that the world's richest cities and
          wealthiest regions would continue to hold their enviable positions in
          the future.
