      <p>
        One of history's most prosperous and well-known investors is
        <span style="font-weight: 800">Peter Lynch</span>. The renowned Lynch
        served as the previous manager of the
        <span style="font-weight: 800"
          >Magellan Fund at the prestigious investment firm Fidelity</span
        >. At the age of 33, he took over the fund and oversaw it for 13 years.
        At age 46, he was able to retire in 1990 because to his accomplishments.
        Lynch's approach to investing has been characterized as flexible to the
        economic climate of the time, but he always emphasized that you should
        be able to comprehend what you possess. <br /><br />
        When Lynch was 11 years old, he was working as a caddy at a high-end
        golf club. While there, he overheard conversations that sparked his
        interest in the stock market. The stock market was doing well at the
        time this occurred. He received a partial scholarship to Boston College,
        and he caddied to cover the remaining costs. He earned a degree in
        finance in 1965. He completed a summer internship with Fidelity in 1966.
        <br /><br />
        <span style="font-weight: 800"
          >Lynch made one of his first profitable investments in the Flying
          Tiger air freight company</span
        >, which enabled him to pay for graduate school. In 1968, he graduated
        with a master's degree in business administration (MBA) from the
        University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business. In the Army
        from 1967 until 1969, he served. Lynch began working full-time at
        Fidelity as a textile and metals analyst when he was 25 years old. He
        caddied for the president of the company for eight years, which probably
        helped him land the position. <br /><br />
        The Magellan Fund, a tiny, aggressive capital appreciation fund founded
        in 1963 that primarily held domestic investments, was taken over by
        Lynch in 1977. A $1,000 investment made the day Lynch took over would
        have grown to $28,000 the day Lynch left. Under his leadership, the fund
        outperformed the S&P 500 for all but two years,
        <span style="font-weight: 800"
          >returning an average of 29% annually.</span
        >
        Lynch is frequently used as an example by investors to show how active
        management can outperform the benchmark. <br /><br />

            One up on Wall Street, written by Peter Lynch,</span
          >
          is the second book on the list and is similarly a more relaxed read.
          It was first released in 1989.<br /><br />
          Legendary Fidelity Investments investor Peter Lynch oversaw the
          management of the Magellan Fund from 1977 to 1990. He increased the
          fund's value from $18 million to $14 billion over this time,
          <span style="font-weight: 800">averaging a 29.2% yearly return</span>.
          Given how absurd that is, it is hardly surprising that more than a
          million copies of the book have been sold globally. The book is
          undoubtedly longer than The Little Book that Beats the Market at 334
          pages, but it's still a fairly simple read. <br /><br />
          The book advocates using what you already know to profit in the stock
          market, and for me, the following passage from the book served as
          somewhat of a wake-up call:
          <br /><br />
          <q style="font-style: italic">
            In general, if you polled all the doctors, I’d bet only a small
            percentage would turn out to be invested in medical stocks, and more
            would be invested in oil; and if you polled the shoe-store owners,
            more would be invested in aerospace than in shoes, while the
            aerospace engineers are more likely to dabble in shoe stocks. Why it
            is that stock certificates, like grasses, are always greener in
            somebody else’s pasture, I’m not sure.
          </q>
          <br /><br />
          The book's chapters 8 and 9 are its high points. In chapter 8, Peter
          Lynch talks about the 13 characteristics of a
          <span style="font-weight: 800">"tenbagger"</span>, which he uses to
          describe equities with a potential gain of tenfold. He highlights six
          characteristics of the inverted tenbagger in chapter 9, alluding to
          equities that are destined for the trash. Some of the qualities of a
          tenbagger he describes in chapter 8 are amusing and rather illogical,
          like: <br /><br />
          1. The institutions don’t own it, and the analysts don’t follow it
          <br /><br />
          2. It’s in a no-growth industry
          <br /><br />3. And best of all … There’s something depressing about it

          Legendary money manager
          <span style="font-weight: 800">Peter Lynch</span> explains his own
          strategies for investing and offers advice for how to pick stocks and
          mutual funds to assemble a successful investment portfolio. Develop a
          Winning Investment Strategy—with Expert Advice from “The Nation’s #1
          Money Manager.” Peter Lynch’s “invest in what you know” strategy has
          made him a household name with investors both big and small.
          <br /><br />
          An important key to investing, Lynch says,<span
            style="font-weight: 800"
          >
            is to remember that stocks are not lottery tickets.</span
          >
          There’s a company behind every stock and a reason companies—and their
          stocks—perform the way they do. In this book, Peter Lynch shows you
          how you can become an expert in a company and how you can build a
          profitable investment portfolio, based on your own experience and
          insights and on straightforward do-it-yourself research.
          <span style="font-weight: 800"
            >In Beating the Street, Lynch for the first time explains how to
            devise a mutual fund strategy</span
          >, shows his step-by-step strategies for picking stock, and describes
          how the individual investor can improve his or her investment
          performance to rival that of the experts. <br /><br />
          There’s no reason the individual investor can’t match wits with the
          experts, and this book will show you how.

          fundamentals of our economic system and what they have to do with the
          stock market—aren’t taught in school. At a time when individuals have
          to make important decisions about saving for college and 401(k)
          retirement funds, this failure to provide a basic education in
          investing can have tragic consequences. <br /><br />
