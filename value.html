          >Value investing is meant to minimise risk by improving the knowledge
          of what you invest in</span
        >, so you can make smarter investment choices and buy at a price that
        offers you a margin of safety. To understand this investment strategy,
        it is important to have a look at the history of value investing and its
        most famous investors. <br /><br />
        Over the decades, value investing has changed.
        <span style="font-weight: 800"
          >Its origins date all the way back to the Great Depression </span
        >and its aftermath, when the strategy’s only objective was to invest in
        businesses that exhibited a lower price than their net tangible assets
        value. Another term that describes this phenomenon is “tangible equity.”
        However, value investing has evolved into a more basic examination of a
        <span style="font-weight: 800">company’s cash flows and profits.</span>
        In addition, value investors consider the competitive advantages of a
        business when deciding if a stock is substantially undervalued.

            The Little Book that Beats the Market </span
          >is the first book on the list and, in my opinion, the first book a
          novice trader should read.
          <span style="font-weight: 800">Joel Greenblatt</span>, the manager of
          the $5.6 billion hedge fund Gotham Funds, is the author of the book,
          which was initially published in 2006. Don't be misled by the book's
          112 pages—it truly earns its title. The Magic Formula, which is
          perhaps my favorite stock screening method, is revealed in The Little
          Book That Beats the Market.<br /><br />
          The price/earnings ratio and returns on assets (or capital) are two
          crucial performance indicators that the
          <span style="font-weight: 800"
            >Magic Formula uses to identify promising stocks</span
          >
          (or earnings yield). Joel Greenblatt provides an insightful and
          humorous explanation of why these two KPIs are necessary for effective
          stock market investment. While reading the book, I frequently found
          myself laughing aloud since it is so outrageous and direct at moments.
          And let me tell you, that's really unusual for a book about investing.
          Take, for example, this passage from the book. Individual stock
          selection is equivalent to scurrying through a dynamite plant with a
          blazing match without any understanding of what you're looking for.
          You may still be alive, but you're a moron. This book is incredibly
          fun to read because it's around 60% educational and 40% humorous. I
          should also mention that the
          <span style="font-weight: 800">Magic Formula</span> screener is

            One up on Wall Street, written by Peter Lynch,</span
          >
          is the second book on the list and is similarly a more relaxed read.
          It was first released in 1989.<br /><br />
          Legendary Fidelity Investments investor Peter Lynch oversaw the
          management of the Magellan Fund from 1977 to 1990. He increased the
          fund's value from $18 million to $14 billion over this time,
          <span style="font-weight: 800">averaging a 29.2% yearly return</span>.
          Given how absurd that is, it is hardly surprising that more than a
          million copies of the book have been sold globally. The book is
          undoubtedly longer than The Little Book that Beats the Market at 334
          pages, but it's still a fairly simple read. <br /><br />
          The book advocates using what you already know to profit in the stock
          market, and for me, the following passage from the book served as
          somewhat of a wake-up call:
          <br /><br />
          <q style="font-style: italic">
            In general, if you polled all the doctors, I’d bet only a small
            percentage would turn out to be invested in medical stocks, and more
            would be invested in oil; and if you polled the shoe-store owners,
            more would be invested in aerospace than in shoes, while the
            aerospace engineers are more likely to dabble in shoe stocks. Why it
            is that stock certificates, like grasses, are always greener in
            somebody else’s pasture, I’m not sure.
          </q>
          <br /><br />
          The book's chapters 8 and 9 are its high points. In chapter 8, Peter
          Lynch talks about the 13 characteristics of a
          <span style="font-weight: 800">"tenbagger"</span>, which he uses to
          describe equities with a potential gain of tenfold. He highlights six
          characteristics of the inverted tenbagger in chapter 9, alluding to
          equities that are destined for the trash. Some of the qualities of a
          tenbagger he describes in chapter 8 are amusing and rather illogical,
          like: <br /><br />
          1. The institutions don’t own it, and the analysts don’t follow it
          <br /><br />
          2. It’s in a no-growth industry
          <br /><br />3. And best of all … There’s something depressing about it

          is listed as number 3 on this list.
          <span style="font-weight: 800">Warren Buffett's company</span>,
          Berkshire Hathaway, is one of the biggest publicly traded businesses
          in existence. Because the author Daniel Pecaut has spent almost 30
          years listening to Warren Buffett and his right-hand man Charlie
          Munger talk about investing at Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder
          meetings, the book's title is highly relevant. The book provides a
          summary of these 30 years. The book has 338 pages, making it nearly
          identical in length as One Up on Wall Street but being slightly more
          complex. It was only released in 2017, so it's also really recent.
          <br /><br />
          Truly, Charlie Munger and Warren Buffett are two brilliant
          individuals. Additionally, they are humorous in addition to being
          brilliant. Just think about what they say when they hear wealthy
          individuals in western nations gripe about high taxes:
          <br /><br />
          <q style="font-style: italic">
            We think — at least I think I’m extraordinarily well treated by this
            society, and I think most people with high incomes are. I think if
            you transported most of them to Bangladesh or Peru or something,
            they would find out how much of it is them and how much is the
            society. Or sometimes they are just really blunt, which is great
            too.
          </q>
          <br /><br />
          Such as when Charlie Munger is asked what he thinks about the GAP
          figure EBITDA which appears in stock market companies’ income
          statements.
          <br /><br />
          <q style="font-style: italic">
            Yeah, I think you would understand any presentation using the word
            EBITDA, if every time you saw that word you just substituted the
            phrase, “bullsh*t earnings.
          </q>
          <br /><br />
          The University of Berkshire Hathaway contains highlights of the<span

            annual shareholder meetings from 1986 to 2017</span
          >
          annual shareholder meetings from 1986 to 2017 in the form of notes.
          Visit the Warren Buffett Archive on CNBC to view the meetings from
          1994 to 2020 for yourself. This is a fantastic resource, however
          because the meetings go roughly five hours each, there will be a total
          of 135 hours of watch time. This book condenses the same material in
          just ten pages.

            Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits by Philip Fisher</span
          >
          is the fourth book I'd advise anyone to read. Warren Buffett is
          frequently credited as being
          <span style="font-weight: 800"
            >85% Benjamin Graham and 15% Philip Fisher</span
          >, and Buffett was particularly influenced by this 1958 book. The book
          is only 200 pages long, yet it contains some harder lessons. They
          aren't more technically or mathematically challenging than anything
          you'll find in the previous three volumes, but it can be challenging
          to put them into practice. Charlie Munger will give you the main
          points of the book as follows: <br /><br />
          <q style="font-style: italic"
            >The basic idea of that it was hard to find good stocks, and it was
            hard to find good investments, and that you wanted to be in good
            investments. And therefore, you just find a few of them that you
            knew a lot about, and concentrate on those, it seemed to me such an
            obviously good idea. And indeed, it’s proved to be an obviously good
            idea. Yet, 98 percent of the investing world doesn’t follow it.
            That’s been good for us. It’s been good for you.</q
          >
          <br /><br />
          Warren Buffett was first introduced to the concept of investing in
          great firms and hanging onto them indefinitely by Phil Fisher. Fisher
          also put his teachings into practice. He supposedly hung on to his
          <span style="font-weight: 800">Motorola</span> investment for decades,
          along with those of his clients, until it turned into a
          <span style="font-weight: 800">2000-bagger.</span>
          With a 2000-bagger, you can become a billionaire with just $500
          invested. One of the book's high points is when Phil Fisher explains
          how regular investors might use resources from the real world to
          outperform Wall Street. He counsels serious investors to research
          firms by speaking to their competitors, suppliers, consumers,
          employees, and ex-workers. According to him, if you spoke with the top
          five businesses in a certain industry and had them individually
          describe the other four, you would be able to tell who the fiercest
          competitor is.

            >The Intelligent Investor by Benjamin Graham </span
          >is item number 5 on this list. This list would not have been possible
          without it, as we all know. I'm not quite impartial, after all. The
          founder of value investing, Benjamin Graham, also trained Warren
          Buffett. Although I would contend that it is not the most
          comprehensive work, The Intelligent Investor is his most well-known
          publication.

          <br /><br />
          The book is more technical than the books that came before it on this
          list, but given that it was first published in 1949, it has
          undoubtedly withstood the test of time. However, if you don't have at
          least some investment expertise, you generally won't get the most out
          of it. Additionally, it has 640 pages.Three main points are made
          throughout the book:
          <br /><br />
          <span style="font-weight: 800">- Intrinsic value:</span> Because a
          stock is an ownership interest in a company, it has an intrinsic (or
          actual) value. <br /><br />
          <span style="font-weight: 800">- Mr. Market:</span> The stock market
          fluctuates between being overly gloomy and enthusiastic. True
          investors are unaffected by Mr. Market's volatile emotions and just
          view price increases and decreases as opportunities rather than as a
          source of knowledge. <br /><br />
          <span style="font-weight: 800">- Margin of Safety:</span> When making
          decisions in the stock market, a margin of safety must always be
          considered. Thus, you must insist on purchasing stocks at a
          significant discount to their fundamental (or true) business worth.

          The sixth book on the list,
          <span style="font-weight: 800">"The Essays of Warren Buffett"</span>,
          was written by Lawrence Cunningham and compiles the key points from
          all of
          <span style="font-weight: 800"
            >Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder letters.</span
          >
          These letters were written by Buffett himself, and the book was
          released in 1997. Despite the book's 328 pages, there is a ton of
          content. Buffett discusses a wide range of topics, including what it
          takes to become a great investor, mergers and acquisitions, what a
          seedy place Wall Street is, how newspapers have evolved, human
          psychology, the failure of academics in finance, the value of
          contrarianism, and back to what a seedy place Wall Street is again.
          <br /><br />
          The quality of Buffett's writing, teaching, and investing are evident
          throughout this book. Even when he makes an effort to explain his
          reasoning to a less knowledgeable audience, there are instances when
          it only demonstrates how much ahead of his intellect is and how
          challenging it may be to understand some of the concepts.
          Nevertheless, a fantastic novel. I should add that almost all of the
          Berkshire Hathaway annual shareholder letters can be found at
          <a href="https://berkshirehathaway.com/letters/letters.html"
            >https://berkshirehathaway.com/letters/letters.html</a
          >
          for free, but Lawrence Cunningham does a great job of distilling the
          information.

          <span style="font-weight: 800">Security Analysis</span>, likewise
          written by <span style="font-weight: 800">Benjamin Graham</span>, is
          the seventh book we have. Although The Intelligent Investor has grown
          in popularity, in my opinion Graham's greatest work is Security
          Analysis. Just a lot more information is covered. And with a whopping
          851 pages broken down into 52 chapters, that makes perfect sense.
          Everything from the psychology of investing to various assets,
          financial statements, portfolio structure, and stock market movements
          will be covered. If you decide to purchase the book, I do suggest
          getting the <span style="font-weight: 800">1940 second edition</span>.
          This edition includes many excellent examples, although some of the
          later editions of the book appear to have slightly misrepresented
          Graham's ideas.I'll highlight three of Security Analysis's best
          chapters here: <br /><br />
          In Chapter 2, it is discussed how crucial it is to examine both
          qualitative and quantitative data when looking for the best results.
          It is examined how these two differ in terms of their worth and
          correctness.
          <br /><br />
          <span style="font-weight: 800"
            >The importance of current-asset values</span
          >
          in public market corporations is discussed in Chapter 43. The
          essential component for screening for net-net stocks, as Benjamin
          Graham was known to do, is this. <br /><br />
          And chapter 50, which discusses the
          <span style="font-weight: 800"
            >differences between stock prices and values </span
          >that can occasionally occur. The chapter discusses where
          discrepancies are most likely to be found, how to be more certain that
          you've found them, and an alternative strategy for stock market
          investing that I haven't personally looked into all that much but that
          does seem promising from a reversion to the mean perspective: Buy
          businesses that are already experiencing financial difficulties rather
          than those that are likely to do so in the future.
