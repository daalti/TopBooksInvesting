          (with a focus on the latter). This book includes a trading simulation
          so that you may practice the topics while also posing potential issues
          that you might run into once trading starts. Problems increase in
          complexity as trade does. <br /><br />
          Making money is the main goal of trading.
          <span style="font-weight: 800"
            >To make money, technical trading uses chart patterns, indicators,
            some basic math, and well-defined rules</span
          >. Even though many great traders rely on instinct, I think they also
          have a computer running in the background, searching for patterns and
          indications that indicate that prices are about to surge forward or
          stop and reverse. You learn via experience what works and what
          doesn't. <br /><br />
          In this course, we'll take some straightforward concepts and apply
          them to profitable trading.
          <span style="font-weight: 800"
            >You are wasting your time if you can't make money off of an
            idea.</span
          >
          Making money is the primary objective of trading. Technical analysis
          can be used to evaluate a stock, index, or futures market objectively.
          No matter whether an analyst claims that a firm is inexpensive or
          whether pro forma performance indicates a potential profit in six
          months, if the price is declining, the time to buy is not now.
          <br /><br />
          <span style="font-weight: 800"
            >Technical analysis alone, though, is insufficient. It doesn't
            provide trading instructions. Between market analysis and trading,
            there is a significant lag that is characterized by trading
            losses.</span
          >
          How do you close that gap without learning from your mistakes? You can
          pick up knowledge from an experienced person. Faster progress is made
          with good counsel, but making mistakes is a necessary and unavoidable
          part of learning. Both teaching you what works and giving you the
          opportunity to make mistakes without losing any money are goals of
          this training. <br /><br />
          Traditional instruction is interspersed with "words of wisdom," a
          selection of trading games that I strongly recommend playing, and
          observations on what is likely to go wrong when you trade. Observing
          the trading of other aspirational students led to the creation of
          those remarks. In order to avoid repeating them, we can learn from
          their errors. For thirty years,
          <span style="font-weight: 800"
            >I've created trading techniques, used them myself, and guided
            others while they were used.</span
          >
          I've benefited from their victories and suffered losses when they
          didn't. I now have a solid understanding of what works and what
          doesn't, as well as the reasons behind each. The goal of this course
          is to impart that knowledge to you. <br /><br />
          If you believe that this is a secret formula for profitable trading,
          you are mistaken. This training consists only of sensible techniques
          and diligent work; there are no secrets. You should be able to use
          what you learn as a strong foundation for future endeavors or to trade
          profitably utilizing simply the information you learned in this
          course.

          Successful trading requires a thorough understanding of price action.
          Trading does not include a complex set of trading strategies. It
          involves keeping your attention on the trading process rather than
          becoming bogged down by a complex array of trading strategies. One of
          the most effective tools in technical analysis is the use of chart
          patterns.

          An extensive manual on the fundamentals of technical analysis for
          dedicated traders. Who is Al Brooks, then? You will find Al Brooks'
          books if you conduct even a simple Google search. Al Brooks has
          produced a number of books on price action trading that go into great
          detail and focus less on trading indicators thanks to his significant
          experience trading with his own money. The finest book, however, is
          Reading Price Charts Bar by Bar. <br /><br />
          This is a superb book on applying technical analysis to price movement
          and chart formations. One for the indicator-free traders who trade
          strictly on instinct. Although this book is less well-known than some
          of his other works, I feel it supersedes his previous three books on
          price action trading because it is a full manual. Anyone who wants to
          understand how to trade effectively and efficiently should read this
          book.

            Additionally, it demonstrates how to execute trades using price
            action.</span

          4.3 out of 5 stars, with most reviewers agreeing that it will
          completely change the way traders think about trading.
