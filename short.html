        Rising stock prices are profitable for many savvy traders. However, some
        people use a technique known as
        <span style="font-weight: 800">short selling </span>to achieve the exact
        opposite, earning from equities that lose value. <br /><br />
        Short selling is borrowing a securities from your brokerage whose price
        you anticipate <span style="font-weight: 800">falling </span>and selling
        it on the open market. Your strategy is to later purchase the same
        stock, preferably at a discount from the price you originally sold it
        for, and keep the difference after paying back the initial loan.
        <br /><br />
        Consider a stock that is now trading at $50 per share. 100 shares that
        you borrowed are sold for $5,000. You earn $2,500 by buying 100 shares
        to replace the ones you borrowed when the price abruptly drops to $25 a
        share.
        <br /><br />
        Despite the apparent simplicity of short selling, there is a
        <span style="font-weight: 800">high level of risk </span>involved in
        this type of speculative trading. Here is a closer look at how it
        functions and some advice before jumping in.

          The most well-known user of the short-selling investment strategy,
          which involves profiting from a stock's collapse, is
          <span style="font-weight: 800">Asensio</span>. Asensio contends that
          <span style="font-weight: 800"
            >this method is ethical and even legal </span
          >despite its unfavorable reputation. In addition to his unrivaled
          six-year track record for identifying overvalued and fraudulent
          stocks, he frequently decides to disclose his research, producing
          reports outlining precisely why his stocks should decline. This makes
          him highly unpopular on Wall Street. His book provides<span
            style="font-weight: 800"
          >
            humorous stories</span
          >
          of businesses whose stock values were unjustifiably boosted by
          management's upbeat press releases (funny, that is, to readers who
          didn't purchase the stocks). <br /><br />
          Some businesses offered no products, others lacked the rights to the
          goods they advertised, and yet others peddled failed medications or
          previously debunked inventions. However, when the book details the
          involvement of significant institutions in these frauds, readers'
          enjoyment will change to concern. Asensio
          <span style="font-weight: 800"
            >demonstrates that the top mutual funds purchased these inflated
            stocks</span
          >, the top investment banks praised them, skeptic business writers
          produced fawning pieces, the stock exchanges permitted open
          manipulation, and in two instances, even the government assisted in
          the scams' continuation. <br /><br />
          Asensio can speak more candidly than publishers' lawyers typically
          permit because he has already been sued (failedly) by several of the
          corporations he exposes. His no-nonsense writing style distinguishes
          his book from the typical staid and pretentious investment coverage.

          By no means is the book
          <span style="font-weight: 800"
            >The Art of Short Selling by Kathryn Staley </span
          >bout short selling. In a nutshell, I would say that the book is
          concentrated on rigorous fundamental examination. It directs all
          readers toward
          <span style="font-weight: 800"
            >identifying and analyzing the core issues a firm has</span
          >. The book makes it very evident that one should never short a solid
          firm simply because it has short-term problems or because it appears
          to be expensive. <br /><br />
          <span style="font-weight: 800"
            >Technical analysis, trends, or volume are not mentioned</span
          >. I bought the book right away since the actual approach of short
          selling outlined is based on a very thorough basic study. The book
          outlines all the things savvy investors should undertake. <br /><br />
          When I saw Kathryn Staley in a video about short selling and what it
          entailed, I was astounded by how little I was actually accomplishing.
          Did you know that for ten years, she intermittently shorted the same
          company? That demonstrates certainty,<span style="font-weight: 800">
            conviction</span
          >, and knowledge of the business. Something that everyone can use,
          especially me. <br /><br />
          You are not taught how to short stocks in The Art of Short Selling. It
          does, however, attempt to demonstrate what to look for in the market,
          the firm, the management, and the financial statements to identify a
          company that is close to experiencing a fundamental breakdown.
