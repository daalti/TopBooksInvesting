        Most investment research professionals in order to conduct the equity
        research look at the earnings growth, return on equity, competitive
        position etc. However, they ignore or pay very less attention to the
        <span style="font-weight: 800"
          >quality of people running the business</span
        >. In fact, both factors matter equally. It’s really important for a
        business to have a sound management team since a
        <span style="font-weight: 800">strong management</span> acts as a
        backbone of any successful company. Warren Buffet emphasises the
        importance of evaluating the people running the business. <br /><br />
        <span style="font-weight: 800">The management </span>is responsible for
        the strategic decisions taken at the company and can be compared to the
        captain of the ship, who physically doesn’t drive the boat but direct
        others to look at various factors which ensures a safe trip. Company’s
        management is responsible for creating value for shareholders and to run
        company in the interest of the shareholders. However, managers are human
        beings and it is practically impossible that they will think only about
        the shareholders and not for personal gain.
        <span style="font-weight: 800"
          >The problem arises when manager’s interest differs from that of
          shareholders</span
        >. Hence in order to solve this conflict, it’s better to tie the
        compensation of management with the interest of shareholders. The main
        problem lies in analyzing company management is that there is no
        dedicated formula for doing so and most aspect of the job is intangible
        in nature. However, you can follow the mentioned guidelines in
        evaluating the quality of management. <br /><br />

          Everybody on Wall Street is familiar with
          <span style="font-weight: 800">Jim Cramer</span>, and Cramer is the
          authority on the market. He oversaw Cramer, Berkowitz for fifteen
          years, one of Wall Street's most prosperous hedge funds with a
          compounded annual return of 24% after all costs. He takes us through
          his love with the stock market as a middle-class child growing up in
          the suburbs of Philadelphia to Harvard, when he started managing
          money, in Confessions of a Street Addict. Cramer began his independent
          career with his wife Karen, the "Trading Goddess," as his partner
          after serving an apprenticeship at Goldman, Sachs.The hectic pace, the
          constant pressure to outperform the market and other fund managers,
          and the shark-like attacks fund managers engage in when they circle a

          <span style="font-weight: 800">Roger Lowenstein </span>depicts the
          thrilling roller-coaster journey of
          <span style="font-weight: 800"
            >Long-Term Capital Management in this business classic</span
          >, which now includes a new Afterword in which the author draws
          comparisons to the current financial crisis. Lowenstein explains not
          only how the fund made and lost its money but also how the
          personalities of Long-partners, Term's the arrogance of their
          mathematical certainty, and the culture of Wall Street itself
          contributed to both their rise and fall. Lowenstein draws on
          <span style="font-weight: 800"
            >confidential internal memos and interviews with dozens of key
            players</span
          >. <br /><br />
          Long-Term was acclaimed as
          <span style="font-weight: 800">the greatest hedge fund ever </span
          >when it was established in 1993. However, after four years in which
          the company impressed Wall Street as a $100 billion moneymaking
          behemoth, it unexpectedly incurred catastrophic losses that imperiled
          not only the stability of the major banks on Wall Street but also the
          financial system as a whole.The tragic tale of Long-demise Term's
          serves as a disturbing premonition of the disaster that would hit all
          of Wall Street a decade later, from Lehman Brothers to AIG. In his new
          Afterword, Lowenstein demonstrates that the collapse of LTCM should
          not be viewed as a singular drama but rather as a model for market
          meltdowns in an era of instability—and as a tragically neglected
          wake-up call by Wall Street and the government.

          do the top traders in the world amass tens or hundreds of millions of
          dollars annually? Are they experts in esoteric knowledge, lucky
          winners in a market lottery, or Mozarts of the markets born with
          virtuosity? Best-selling author Jack D. Schwager spoke with hundreds
          of elite traders from the majority of financial markets in pursuit of
          an explanation. <br /><br />
          Although the specifics of their comments varied, all of them could be
          reduced to the same fundamental formula: sound approach with the
          <span style="font-weight: 800"
            >right mental attitude equals trading success</span
          >. In Market Wizards, Schwager lets you hear what those super-traders
          had to say about their extraordinary triumphs in their own words
          before distilling their comments into a list of rules you may follow

          For this second memoir, in which he leaves the institutional
          investment world behind to co-manage a hedge fund, Kessler has toned
          down the name-dropping that permeated last year's<span

          >
          , and his less-than-appreciative stance towards much of the rest of
          the finance industry is also somewhat altered. Despite not having much
          of a game plan to begin with, loosely related episodes follow his
          attempts to draw investors and raise the $100 million he needs to be
          taken seriously. The Industrial Revolution and the beginnings of
          networked computers are then studied by

          "Mr. Zed" <br /><br />
          These historical asides are written in an intimate style, but in a
          friendly key. In the end, Kessler comes to the conclusion that the
          next big thing is likely to be found in "high margin" sectors like
          intellectual property, which may be sold for significantly more than
          they cost to produce. His admittedly "counterintuitive" theory holds
          that American investments in foreign goods would help those nations'
          economy grow so they may make investments in our intellectual property
          and the businesses that produce it, creating wealth for everyone.
          While readers who preferred Kessler's direct style the first time
          around will still find plenty to like here,<span
