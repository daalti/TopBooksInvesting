        Financial markets almost always favor the
        <span style="font-weight: 800">herd mentality</span>. The majority of
        market players concur that either the stock market is performing well
        and should continue to post gains or that the market is
        <span style="font-weight: 800">struggling and will be lower</span> next
        week than it is right now. <br /><br />
        <span style="font-weight: 800">Holding an unpopular opinion </span>about
        the market and conducting the appropriate research to ascertain whether
        there is an investment opportunity is known as contrarian investing.
        Successful contrarian investors must be prepared to put in a lot of time
        analyzing market circumstances in order to support their position.
        <br /><br />
        <span style="font-weight: 800">A contrarian investor</span> can choose
        to make investments based on the premise that the economy won't develop
        faster than it is now and that stock prices will fall, for example, if
        the general market opinion is that the speed of economic expansion will
        quicken, generating more market gains.
        <span style="font-weight: 800"
          >The famous contrarian investor Warren Buffett </span
        >aptly encapsulated the idea when he said, "Be greedy when others are
        scared, and fearful when others are greedy." <br /><br />
        An investor may need several weeks or months to completely build a
        contrarian opinion, and it may take even longer for their plan to
        succeed. Investors who take a contrarian approach must feel at ease with
        the risks and possible losses involved in holding back. Contrarians seek
        to enter trades before the prevailing view changes in their favor by
        making early investment selections that are consistent with their point
        of view.

          that demonstrates why the majority of investment strategies are
          fatally flawed and why his contrarian strategies are the best way to
          outperform the market in this significant revision of his investment
          classic. <br /><br />
          There has never been a greater pressing need to change how you invest.
          <span style="font-weight: 800">The Crash of 2007</span> made it
          dramatically clear that the efficient market theory, which forms the
          basis of all popular investing methods, had serious faults. The
          powerful new psychological research David Dreman introduces has
          revealed significant, systematic errors in human judgment that are not
          taken into account by this theory or any of the most widely used
          investing strategies. These errors include emotional overreactions and
          a variety of mental shortcuts in judgment that cause wildly inflated
          and deflated prices for stocks, bonds, and commodities as well as
          bubbles and crashes. Additionally, it produces seriously erroneous
          risk assessments. <br /><br />
          <span style="font-weight: 800">Dreman demonstrates</span> precisely
          how the most recent psychology research completely disproves those
          techniques and demonstrates how his counterintuitive alternative
          <span style="font-weight: 800">strategies effectively </span
          >accommodate for them. He demonstrates to readers how they can become
          savvy psychological investors, crash-proof their portfolios, and
          generate long-term returns that outperform the market by being aware
          of these new insights. He also offers several extremely effective
          solutions for dealing with the most pressing issues in the upcoming
          years, such as significantly increased volatility and the possibility
          of inflation. He also provides a
          <span style="font-weight: 800">new theory of risk </span>and
          dramatically improves his fundamental contrarian strategies. This is
          the key manual for smart investment that every investor needs.
