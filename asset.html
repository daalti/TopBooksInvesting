          The outcomes of
          <span style="font-weight: 800"
            >David Swensen's investment approach</span
          >
          for the Yale University endowment have remained as spectacular as ever
          despite the tremendous changes in the global investment landscape
          since the publication of the now-classic
          <span style="font-weight: 800"> Pioneering Portfolio Management</span
          >. Yale's portfolio has consistently outperformed the market by a
          considerable margin, and with over $20 billion added to the endowment
          over his twenty-three-year tenure, Swensen has made the largest
          financial contribution to any American university. Before the Internet
          bubble burst, what might have seemed like one of many success stories
          is now seen as a completely unique institutional investment
          accomplishment. <br /><br />
          Swensen, the author of the best-selling personal finance book
          Unconventional Success, explains the investing strategy behind Yale's
          endowment in this completely revised and updated edition. He offers
          clear and insightful insight into the world of institutional fund
          management, shedding light on subjects like active fund management and
          asset allocation schemes. Swensen uses a variety of colorful
          real-world examples, many of which are based on his own extensive
          experience, to discuss important ideas including managing risk,
          choosing advisors, and navigating market hazards.
          <br /><br />
          <span style="font-weight: 800"
            >Swensen provides insightful guidance, particularly when explaining
            a method that seems to go against logic</span
          >. Typical investment frequently results in purchasing high and
          selling low. Trust is more significant than short-lived success.
          Whereas gimmicks and trend following fail to provide outcomes,
          expertise, tenacity, and the long view do. <br /><br />
          In the original Pioneering Portfolio Management, a practical framework
          for building a well-diversified equity-oriented portfolio was
          presented. A current overview of actively managed investment
          portfolios is provided by this updated version for fund managers and
          market researchers.
