            style="font-weight: 800"
            >The goal of behavioral investing is to bring psychology and
            investing closer together</span
          >. Too many investors are blind to the mental traps that lie in wait
          for them. Even after being conscious of our prejudices, we must
          acknowledge that information does not always translate into action.
          Designing and implementing an investing procedure that is at least
          somewhat resistant to behavioral decision-making errors is the answer.
          <br /><br /><span style="font-weight: 800"
            >A Practitioner's Guide to Using Behavioral Finance, Behavioural
            Investing encourages readers to adopt an empirically based sceptical
            approach to investing </span
          >by examining the biases we face and how they manifest themselves
          during the investment process. This book is exceptional in that it
          combines knowledge of the investment problem with insights from the
          field of applied psychology. Any investment professional wanting to
          enhance their investing behavior to maximize returns will find this
          book to be necessary reading because it is entirely
          practitioner-focused. <br /><br />
          <span style="font-weight: 800"> Who this book is for:</span>
          <br /><br />My go-to resource for investment psychology is James
          Montier's Behavioral Investing. Although it is geared toward traders
          and financial professionals, it may be a helpful tool for any informed
          investor. James Montier, an internationally recognized authority in
          his profession. Expect to see real-world examples that demonstrate how
          applying a model with psychological inspiration can enhance standard
          investing practices.
          <span style="font-weight: 800"
            >This book is all about using investing psychology in the real world </span
          >, not just having a few "aha" moments while reading. This dedication
          to application is what propels this book to the top of my list. This
          is a practical guide on investment psychology.

          The two systems of the human spirit are described in Daniel Kahneman's
          book Thinking Fast and Slow.
          <span style="font-weight: 800"
            >System 1 is the more impulsive and automatic thinking that we have.
            System 2 on the other hand is the conscious </span
          >and aware mind that enables us to reason through specific issues in
          order to arrive at logical judgments. This book is relevant to
          personal finance because many investors make impulsive, irrational
          decisions that cause system 1 to interfere. Investors must apply both
          systems without letting one take precedence over the other. While
          making difficult investment decisions, this book will assist you in
          achieving both thinking systems.

          <span style="font-weight: 800"> Who this book is for:</span>
          <br /><br />
          The only investing psychology book I've included on my top 5 list that
          concentrates on day trading or short-term trading is High Performance
          Trading.
          <span style="font-weight: 800"
            >Day trading entails additional stress, such as the emotional and
            psychological toll of practicing your trade for more than eight
            hours each day. </span
          >If you are a day trader, you should look for a book on investment
          psychology that addresses these issues as well as the classic investor
          conundrums of "buy vs. sell" and "greed vs. fear."
