        Investing is an effective way to put your money to work and could make
        you richer. If you make smart investing choices, your money may increase
        in value and outpace inflation. The key factors influencing investment's
        larger growth potential are the power of compounding and the trade-off
        between risk and return.

          Peter Lynch is the most well-known investment "sage" of the modern
          era. Not only has his investment strategy passed the real-world
          performance test, but he is adamant that applying it gives individual
          investors a clear edge over Wall Street and big money managers.
          Individual investors, in his opinion, are more free to implement this
          fundamental strategy since they are not constrained by bureaucratic
          regulations and concerns about immediate results.
          <br /><br />
          At Fidelity Management and Research, where he also achieved much
          notoriety as manager of Fidelity's Magellan Fund, Mr. Lynch formed his
          investment philosophy. During Mr. Lynch's tenure, which began in 1977
          with the fund's establishment and lasted in 1990 with Mr. Lynch's
          retirement, the fund consistently ranked among the top stock funds.
          <br /><br />
          Peter Lynch takes a strictly bottom-up method, choosing firms from the
          investor's known list and then conducting fundamental analysis,
          emphasizing in-depth knowledge of the business, its future, its
          market, and if the stock can be bought at a fair price. His
          best-selling book "One Up on Wall Street" outlines his fundamental
          technique and offers plenty of pointers for how ordinary investors
          might modify and apply it. The concept of his first book is expanded
          upon in "Beating the Street," his most recent book, which also offers
          instances of his approach to particular businesses and industries in
          which he has invested. These serve as the article's main sources.

          Warren Buffett, or Warren Edward Buffett, is an American businessman
          and philanthropist who was born on August 30, 1930, in Omaha,
          Nebraska. He is widely regarded as the most successful investor of the
          20th and early 21st centuries, having defied prevailing investment
          trends to amass a personal fortune of more than $100 billion.
          <br /><br />
          Buffett, also referred to as the "Oracle of Omaha," was the son of
          Nebraskan U.S. Representative Howard Homan Buffett. He studied under
          Benjamin Graham at the Columbia University School of Business after
          receiving his B.S. from the University of Nebraska in 1950. (M.S.,
          1951). In 1965, Buffett acquired majority ownership of textile company
          Berkshire Hathaway Inc., making it his main investment vehicle.
          Buffett had moved back to Omaha in 1956. The major stock indices
          soared by around 11% yearly from the 1960s through the 1990s, but
          Berkshire Hathaway's publicly listed shares increased by nearly 28%
          annually.
