            >Value investing is an investment strategy that involves the use of
            fundamental analysis </span
          >to find securities that are selling below their perceived intrinsic
          value. While there is no single way to calculate intrinsic value,
          analysts and investors commonly use<span style="font-weight: 800">
            measures such as a stock's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio or
            price-to-book (P/B) ratio
          </span>
          >to identify value stocks. A value investing strategy is generally
          contrasted with a growth investing strategy, which seeks to find
          stocks with the best ability to grow their earnings over time. As a
          result, value stocks generally pay dividends and have lower relative
          P/E multiples,<span style="font-weight: 800">
            whereas growth stocks generally do not pay dividends and have higher
            P/E multiples.</span

          Based on market data,
          <span style="font-weight: 800"
            >technical analysis is a tool or strategy used to forecast the
            likely future price movement </span
          >of a security, such as a stock or currency pair. The idea that all
          market participants' aggregate buying and selling accurately reflects
          all pertinent information regarding a traded security and subsequently
          assigns a fair market value to the security is the basis for the
          legitimacy of technical analysis. <br /><br />
          Technical traders think that
          <span style="font-weight: 800"
            >the most accurate predictor of future price action is the market's
            recent or current price action.</span
          >
          Technical traders are not the only ones that employ technical
          analysis. Many fundamental traders utilize technical analysis to
          identify favorable, low-risk buy entry price levels after using
          fundamental analysis to decide whether to purchase into a market.

            >Psychology informs us that people are biased, mistaken, and
            susceptible to perceptual illusions </span
          >when processing information. Therefore, it stands to reason that
          bias, inaccuracy, and perceptual illusions will also affect our
          financial judgments.
          <span style="font-weight: 800"
            >The primary lesson of behavioural finance, which supports this
            claim, is that psychology genuinely permeates every aspect of the
            financial world.</span

          <br /><br />According to conventional financial theory, markets are
          efficient, investors are logical, and risk alone determines expected
          profits.<span style="font-weight: 800">
            Behavioral finance theory, on the other hand, views investors as
            typical and markets as inefficient,</span
          >
          with projected returns influenced by more than just riskâ€”emotional
          variables, for instance, play a significant role. <br /><br />In
          actuality, this implies that even when we think we are making logical,
          reasoned decisions, feelings like fear and greed can overcome them and
          put our wise investing decisions in jeopardy. What then can we do to
          combat these negative feelings?<br /><br />
